# Google Map Markers - My Life

## Description

I have used the Google Maps API to pin-point locations which are associated with my life. I have created a small information box also for users, giving each location a letter as a reference. I have went for functionality more than style for this project, I have kept the design clear and simple for users.

## UX

### User Stories

1. As a user, I would like to see a section which references each location by a symbol, in this case by letters.

   - **End User Goal:** User is able to see a small box that references each location to a letter.
   - **End Business Goal:** There is a small box referencing each location to a letter.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** For users to see and understand the references in the information box.
   - **Measurement Of Success:** Check live demo.

2. As a user, when I load the page, I should see the number of markers that are referenced in this app.

   - **End User Goal:** User is able to see the number of markers referenced.
   - **End Business Goal:** The correct number of references shown on the map.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** For users to see the number of referenced markers used on the map
   - **Measurement Of Success:** Check live demo.

3. As a user, I would like to click on the numbers, zooming me in closer to the selected marker.
   - **End User Goal:** User is able to click on the numbers which will zoom in.
   - **End Business Goal:** The number markers are zoomed in when clicked.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** For users to be able to click on the numbers and zoom in.

## Cloning and Pushing To The Respository

### Cloning:

- Here is a link how to clone a repository:
  https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

### Pushing To The Respository:

- To add, commit and push files to the repository, e.g. index.html, open a New Terminal and type:

1. git add index.html
2. git commit -m "Leave a message here"
3. git push origin master - (which is for the master branch).

- To create a new branch within your current application, open a New Terminal:

1. Create a branch: git checkout -b new-branch-name
2. Edit, add to your application and commit the files.
3. Push the branch to the remote repository: git push origin new-branch-name.

## Roadmap

In the future I would like to implement:

- Add more locations referencing my life.
